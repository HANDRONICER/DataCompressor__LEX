//Every kind person is part of mankind as it cares about their world
//there also exist the detrimentals of ourselves: 
//animals as they just follow their insticts without thinking?,
//monsters as they just follow only their mind without etics?, 
//or fools as they just do cause they can without thinking about the consecuences of their actions?
//kinds CARE ABOUT OUR LEGACY TO GIVE AND SUSTAIN, NOT TO TAKE AND DEVOUR.

  //0636: What is wrong with repos?, they aren't easy like On cloud Drive Services at the moment to upload, donwload is cool cause "click and go".

//dic_23_2023:
  //0353: Got some moral problems and divergent thinking when setting 2FA by github, I know that having a phone is cool, but in my country you can get your phone taken away by bad people and is so normal like breathing, I lost my crypto wallet like that cause enabled my 2FA. Also clone the ALFREDO MEZA rust learning Repo.

  //0513: It's Chrismas!!! Happy celebration to Every one reading this!!!, now i log my progress, installed AWS Whisperer in my VsCode Enviroment it's great, I wanted to Test GithubCopilot but they rejected every document I send as student until I got a msg: Reviewing your docs. Hope get the student things.
          From now I'm learning how to use properly github and Rust_Lang, so "hip hip hurra!" to make further progress. note: Rust_Book is good.

//dic_25,26:
  //2038: Took a course of GIT and finish it, is more easy that i think, and also feels now at the time like overcomplicating something that should be plain simple: as I saw Git is this: (Reference: https://github.com/HANDRONICER/GitTest_Lex.git/GitNotes.txt), now i'm capable of doing git correctly. at the moment I organize and simplify my notes.

//dic_27:
  //1456: Having fun with git and cheching what it can do and how to manage my repositories efficiently, today I learn more about developing my rust skills by reading rustbook and taking a course.

dic_28,29:
  //0605?: Focused on reading the rust lang book and advancing on the proyects that the book describes.

dic_30:
  //0448: Uploaded the first 3 proyects that the book describes to the GitHub repository: "Rusty_Lex"
  //2052: BookMark to continue reading: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-00-common-programming-concepts.html

  //0708: Checking the MARKDOWN LANGUAGE as candidate to take notes, personally I like to take notes using the OneNote By microsoft, cause is convenient and fastlike as taking notes in paper.
  //0710: Also still ordering some notes of My own Rust learning path.
