//Every kind person is part of mankind as it cares about their world
//there also exist the detrimentals of ourselves: 
//animals as they just follow their insticts without thinking?,
//monsters as they just follow only their mind without etics?, 
//or fools as they just do cause they can without thinking about the consecuences of their actions?
//kinds CARE ABOUT OUR LEGACY TO GIVE AND SUSTAIN, NOT TO TAKE AND DEVOUR.

//dic_22_2023: created a space for my works, i didn't sleep well, back hurt and my mind too, but there is always hope, need to rest and recharge batt.
