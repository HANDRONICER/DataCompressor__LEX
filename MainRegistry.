//Every kind person is part of mankind as it cares about their world
//there also exist the detrimentals of ourselves: 
//animals as they just follow their insticts without thinking?,
//monsters as they just follow only their mind without etics?, 
//or fools as they just do cause they can without thinking about the consecuences of their actions?
//kinds CARE ABOUT OUR LEGACY TO GIVE AND SUSTAIN, NOT TO TAKE AND DEVOUR.

  //0353: Got some moral problems and divergent thinking when setting 2FA by github, I know that having a phone is cool, but in my country you can get your phone taken away by bad people and is so normal like breathing, I lost my crypto wallet like that cause enabled my 2FA.
